Aside from the parsing this crate also provides a translator from the intermediate representation provided by [operation](./operation/) to
symex `general_assembly`. This is done using the [transpiler](github.com/ivario/transpiler). This is not intended to be a part of this crate and will be moved out of it in to [symex](github.com/s7rul/symex) in the near future.
